				<h2>Where to Find Patterns</h2>
				<h3>Physical Patterns</h3>
				<p>For those who prefer patterns in physical form, and either don’t have the means or can’t be bothered to print out a pattern themselves, buying pattern books are the way to go. You can buy books of patterns in a store or order some online. These books are good if you want a bunch of patterns in one style or theme all at once for one price. They are also good if you want a break from looking at a screen to read patterns or are in a place with little or no internet.</p>
				<h3>Websites</h3>
				<p>There are many websites where you can find free patters or buy patterns from creators. These websites are usually pleasing to the eye, easy to read and understand, especially for beginners, and have a plethora of patterns and information. Some of these sites also include images or videos to help explain the pattern to the user.</p>
				<p>Two websites I like are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://sarahmaker.com/category/crochet/">Sarah Maker</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.hookedbyrobin.com/">Hooked By Robin</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>YouTube</h3>
				<p>There are many YouTube accounts that have tutorials of patterns. These videos can be great for beginners or for people who prefer in detailed instructions with accompanied video. These patterns and tutorials are all free</p>
				<p>One account I like is <a href="https://youtube.com/@mahumcrochets?si=clVcirr0-kMTYZsy">Mahhumcrochets</a></p>
				<h3>Instagram</h3>
				<p>Lots of crocheters who sell their creations and/or their own patterns, use Instagram as their marketing platform. These creators also may sell their products on their website, although not all of these Instagram accounts have a website attached. Some of these accounts post their patterns for free. There are also some accounts that post other accounts free patterns, but be careful to only use the ones that credit the original owner, or find the original owner before using or posting/selling the pattern.</p>
				<p>Most of the patterns I use I find while scrolling on Instagram, saving these posts and accounts to use later. On these accounts, usually you can find smaller patterns that can be done more quickly, but sometimes you can find more complex patterns, usually of clothing.</p>
