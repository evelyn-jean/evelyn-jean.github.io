			<h2>What is Crochet?</h2>
				<p>Crochet is a form of craft. It involves some sort of yarn, a crochet hook, and a pattern. Many things can be made from crochet, from clothes to toys to almost anything you can imagine. </p>
				<p>Now, you may be thinking, “Isn’t that the thing old people do?” well, you are correct. But you are also incorrect. While old people do crochet, its not just for old people. You youngin’s can crochet too. Lots of people crochet, not only as a hobby, but as their job, creating clothes or toys that they sell online, in a store or at markets.</p>

				<h2>Why Choose Crochet?</h2>
				<p>Personally, I love crochet. I find it super relaxing to just zone out and do a mindless crochet. I like to crochet to wind down or to keep my hands busy when watching a tv show.</p>
				<p>With crochet, you can make all sorts of gifts for friends or family, instead of going out and buying things. You can also make things for yourself, like articles of clothing, saving money.  But, be warned… you may end up spending all your money on yarn.</p>
				<p>Although crochet is super fun, it can also be pretty time consuming. So make sure you have a lot of free time and patience on your hands when taking on big projects.</p>
