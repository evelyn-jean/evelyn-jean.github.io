				<h2 class="h2image">Bunny</h2>
			    <img src="Bunny_1.jpg" alt="Bunny crochet" class="imgcenter" >
				<br>
<p>This bunny was fun and easy to make. It was a bit longer of a project and there was a couple of things I hadn’t done before- attaching arms and ears and working up from legs- but nonetheless it was very enjoyable to do and it produced a final cute bunny plush! I plan to remake it in all sorts of colours and designs to make cut little gifts for friends and family.</p>
				<p>I found this pattern on Instagram by the account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/all_the_right_knots7/">@all_the_right_knots7</a></p>
				<p>Last time I checked, at the making of this website, the pattern is pinned at the top of the page.</p>

				<h2 class="h2image">Log Cabin Blanket</h2>
				<img src="log.jpg" alt="Log cabin blanket crochet" class="imgcenter">
				<br>
				<p>I haven’t quite finished this project yet, as it is more of a long one. But, this mindless rochet project is quite fun to zone out and repeat the same pattern over and over while on a long trip or watching tv. This project is good to do if you need to keep your hands busy, and once you’re done, you’ll have a nice warm blanket! There is also no limit to how large, or small, you can make it. You can also experiment with all the different colour patterns.</p>

				<h2 class="h2image">Minecraft Creeper</h2>
				<img src="creeper.jpg" alt="Creeper crochet" class="imgcenter">
				<br>
				<p>I found this pattern while looking for one to make for my younger cousin as he is very into Minecraft at the moment. I found it very quick to make, finishing almost half of it in an afternoon. I did find a couple of the steps in each round a bit weird so I stopped doing them, and I didn’t use the mesh plastic panels so my creeper is a bit rounder, but besides that it still looks like the loveable Minecraft creeper.</p>

				<h2 class="h2image">Blueberry</h2>
			<img src="berry.jpg" alt="blueberry crochet" class="imgcenter">
				<br>
<p>I did this pattern on a bit of a whim, with nothing else to do. I found it fun and it created a cute little blueberry. I didn’t add the eyes because I don’t own safety eyes, but nonetheless I love it. I found the ruffles a but tricky to get a hand of at first, but soon enough I understood it.</p>

				<img src="worm.jpg" alt="worry worm crochet" class="imgcenter"/>
				<br>
<p>I tested this pattern for my grandma, and it was very quick and simple to complete. Once completed, it was fun to fiddle around and play with as a fidget toy.</p>

				<h2 class="h2image">Star Pouch</h2>
				<img src="pouch_1.jpg" alt="star pouch crochet" class="imgcenter"/>
				<br>
<p>I came across this pattern and had a lot of fun trying it out. I had never made a granny square before, so I had no idea what I was doing. But I found this tutorial very easy to follow and understand. I love the outcome, and I plan to make more pouches with different colour patterns.</p>
				<p>You can find this pattern by Katelyn on YouTube.</p><iframe class="full-width-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Wt32nPaUi4?si=WU52FpmM3o69M8fz&amp;controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

				<h2 class="h2image">Christmas Bauble</h2>
				<img src="bauble1.jpg" alt="red bauble crochet" class="imgcenter"/>
				<br>
			  <img src="bauble2.jpg" alt="silver bauble crochet" class="imgcenter"/>
				<br>
<p>This pattern is included in the DK A little course in… Crochet, labelled ‘Toy Balls’, but I added a loop of string at the top so I could hang it up on a Christmas tree. This pattern is simple and fun, and a good practice for starting magic rings and closing them off. I made a few of these, starting off not knowing magic rings and finishing being very confident in magic rings. I recommend this pattern to beginners or for people who want to get more confidence in magic rings.</p>

				<h2 class="h2image">Mini Garland</h2>
				<img src="garland.jpg" alt="Mini garland crochet" class="imgcenter">
				<br>
				<p>This pattern is fun and good to do if you have the end of a ball of yarn that isn’t long enough to make a larger project. You can stop this project at any time, making it as long as you want. The final product is a cute decoration that you can hang up around the house. I made this originally to put up as a Christmas decoration.</p>

				<p>You’ll scroll down for a while to find this pattern as it is from a while ago.</p>

				<br>
<p>I made a lot of this pattern. It is a good pattern for practicing magic rings and sewing together sides. The final product is a cute star that you can put anywhere. I didn’t add the eyes, instead adding a loop of string and hanging it up on my Christmas tree. This pattern is fun to experiment with different colours and types of yarn.</p>
